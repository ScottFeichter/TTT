WAY TO CREATE/HOST A WEBPAGE

Several ways to do this in AWS
For this we will use Amplify to deploy and HOST

1. Create index.html
2. Make some boiler plate in the file (Q to the rescue)
3. Zip it up and zip it out

        in shell to zip a file:
        zip zipped_name.zip file1.txt file2.txt etc

        in shell to zip a directory:
        zip -r zipped_name.zip directory_name

4. Use amplify to deploy

        use the console, cli, or api

        if in cli follow the prompts and drag and drop
